# IoT_Project
Developed an IoT system to monitor key beehive parameters including temperature, humidity, sound, movement,  and bee count. The system aimed to increase honey production by providing real-time data to beekeepers, enabling better hive  management, prediction of swarming activities, and timely honey collection.
